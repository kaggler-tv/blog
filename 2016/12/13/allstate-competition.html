<p>I participated in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity/">the Allstate competition</a> at Kaggle and finished 54th out of 3,055 teams.  I shared my solution in the forum after the competition <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity/forums/t/26459/code-and-notes-for-56-solution-more">here</a>:</p>

<p>Congrats for winners and top performers, and thanks for great sharing to all contributors in the forum. It’s always a humbling experience to compete at Kaggle. I learn so much at every competition from a lot of fellow kagglers.</p>

<p>Here I’d like to share my code base and notes for the competition:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://gitlab.com/jeongyoonlee/allstate-claims-severity">Code repo with competition notes</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://gitlab.com/jeongyoonlee/allstate-claims-severity/wikis/home">Wiki page with internal LB</a></li>
</ul>

<p>My friends and I have been using the framework based on Makefiles for competitions for years now and it has worked great so far.</p>

<p>Introduction to the framework is available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-mobile-user-demographics/forums/t/23463/team-ensemble-s-solution-framework">the TalkingData forum</a></p>

<p>Our previous code repo for past competitions are also available at:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://gitlab.com/mbay/bosch">For Bosch (#22)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://gitlab.com/jeongyoonlee/talkingdata">For TalkingData (#37)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Hope it’s helpful.</p>
