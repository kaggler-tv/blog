<h1 id="layoff--my-story">Layoff â€“ My Story</h1>

<p>Update: I was not affected by the layoff in the news. Iâ€™m sharing about the one I had a while ago. I donâ€™t need a new opportunity for now. Thanks for asking. ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>It was one of less ideal days at work.</p>

<p>While getting ready for work, I received an email announcing the layoff of over 400 people in marketing.</p>

<p>At work, a series of follow-up meetings got scheduled. I talked to my team, who didnâ€™t get affected, to address any concerns.</p>

<p>Later in the afternoon, farewell emails began to arrive. I replied to some, wished the best, and connected to them on LinkedIn.</p>

<p>It surely hurts when it happens. Either to me or to my colleagues.</p>

<hr />

<p>I was laid off in 2001. It was just 9 months after I started my first full time job when the company shut down my department. I was confused, angry and felt like a failure, then I cried.</p>

<p>Looking back, I am thankful for the experience.</p>

<p><strong>It opened up better opportunities.</strong> With the previous work experience, the job search was much easier. I had better understanding of what I could offer, and which companies needed it. In the end, I landed at a company with a greater fit.</p>

<p><strong>It helped me have the right mindset at work.</strong> At the new company, I grew so much and so fast because I was humbled and grateful for the new opportunity every day.</p>

<p><strong>It also gave me a better perspective on my career.</strong> Since then, no matter how I like my job, I keep reminding myself that â€œthis wonâ€™t be my last companyâ€œ. Employment can change, but relationship, skills and experiences will last. Itâ€™s wise to focus on what will last.</p>

<hr />

<p>If it happens again, it will still hurt, but I wonâ€™t feel the same confusion, anger or failure. I wonâ€™t cry. ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>I hope all my colleagues keep their heads up, get stronger and wiser, and find better opportunities.</p>

<p>Best wishes for their career and families.</p>
