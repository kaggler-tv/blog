<p>by Jeong-Yoon Lee</p>

<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Giuliano-Janson">Giuliano Janson</a> gave a great perspective as an ex-Kaggle addict who successfully recovered from it. Let me give mine as an active Kaggle addict, who is helpless without any hope for rehab. ;)</p>

<p>I have a weekly Data Science journal club at work, which I turned into a weekly Kaggle club. I invite people from outside the company as well and now we have about 10 people joining from 4 different companies.</p>

<p>Today, as we did post-mortem on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs">the Quora competiton</a> that ended earlier this week, one of attendees, who is relatively new to Kaggle, shared that she found it very addictive.</p>

<p>I agreed with her and added that it is addictive because it is so to observe yourself improving, just like how work-out and career advancement can be addictive. It is a different kind of addiction from ones that harm yourself.</p>

<p>At the post-mortem meeting, we shared lists of things that we learned from the competition: Feature engineering in NLP with various embeddings, good ML implementations such as LightGBM, XGBoost and Keras, new deep learning architectures combining LSTM or CNN with meta features, and many more.</p>

<p>And we talked about which competition to enter next. Yeah, we don’t need a break. We need another dose of a competiton, or , as I like to put, a deliberate practice opportunity.</p>

<p>One tip for me to remain addicted for a long time - past 6 years - is that I don’t compete to rank higher, but I compete to learn more and have fun with others. That’s why I compete with a team with different people at various skill levels, including first time Kagglers.</p>

<p>How do I feel? I feel great to be addicted to Kaggle and even better to be addicted to self improvement. :)</p>

<p>At the Quora competition, we finished 36th out of 3,307 teams. One of members was a first timer. Yeah, I gave him a pretty good gateway drug. No regret! ;)</p>
