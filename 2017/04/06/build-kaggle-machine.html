<p>In 2014, I shared <a href="http://kaggler.com/2015/09/21/kagglers-toolbox.html">the specifications of a 6-core 64GB RAM desktop system</a> that I purchased at around USD 2,000. Since then, I added NVidia Titan X to it for deep learning at additional USD 1,000, and it served me well.</p>

<p>However, as other team members started joining me on data science competitions and deep learning competitions got more popular, my team decided to build a more powerful desktop system.</p>

<p>The specifications of the new system that we built are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>CPU</strong>: Xeon 2.4GHz 14-Core</li>
  <li><strong>RAM</strong>: 128GB DDR4-2400</li>
  <li><strong>GPU</strong>: 4 NVidia 1080 Ti 11GB</li>
  <li><strong>SSD</strong>: 960GB</li>
  <li><strong>HDD</strong>: 4TB 7200RPM</li>
  <li><strong>PSU</strong>: 1600W 80+ Titanium certified</li>
</ul>

<p>Total cost including tax and shipping was around USD 7,000. Depending on the budget, you can go down to 2 (-USD 1,520) 1080 Ti GPU cards instead of 4, or 64GB (-USD 399) instead of 128GB RAM, and still have a decent system at around USD 5,000.</p>
