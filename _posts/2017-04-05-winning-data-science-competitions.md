# Winning Data Science Competitions – Latest Slides

![](/images/20170405-winning-ds-competition.jpg)

This year I had several occasions to give my "Winning Data Science Competitions" talk – at Microsoft, KSEA-SWC 2017, USC Applied Statistics Club, Spark SC, and Whisper.

I am grateful for all these opportunities to share what I enjoy with the data scientist community.

I truly believe that working on competitions on a regular basis can make us better data scientists. Hope my talk and slides help other data scientists.

My talk is outlined as follows:

* Why compete
  * For fun
  * For experience
  * For learning
  * For networking
* Data science competition intro
  * Competitions
  * Structure
  * Kaggle
* Misconceptions of data science competitions
  * No ETL?
  * No EDA?
  * Not worth it?
  * Not for production?
* Best practices
  * Feature engineering
  * Diverse algorithms
  * Cross validation
  * Ensemble
  * Collaboration
* Personal tips
* Additional resources
