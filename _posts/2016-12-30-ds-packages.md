# Great Packages for Data Science in Python and R

by Hang Li

Domino’s Chief Data Scientist, [Eduardo Ariño de la Rubia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/earino) talk about Python and R as the “best” language for data scientists.
A list of useful packages from [this talk](https://blog.dominodatalab.com/video-huge-debate-r-vs-python-data-science/).

# Python

* Feather – Fast, interoperable binary data frame storage for Python, R, and more powered by Apache Arrow
* Ibis  – Productivity-centric Python data analysis framework for SQL systems and the Hadoop platform. Co-founded by the creator of pandas
* Paratext  – A library for reading text files over multiple cores.
* Bcolz  – A columnar data container that can be compressed.
* Altair  – Declarative statistical visualization library for Python
* Bokeh  – Interactive Web Plotting for Python
* Blaze  – NumPy and Pandas interface to Big Data
* Xarry  – N-D labeled arrays and datasets in Python
* Dask  – Versatile parallel programming with task scheduling
* Keras – High-level neural networks library, written in Python and capable of running on top of either TensorFlow or Theano.
* PyMC3  – Probabilistic Programming in Python: Bayesian Modeling and Probabilistic Machine Learning with Theano

# R

* Feather – Fast, interoperable binary data frame storage for Python, R, and more powered by Apache Arrow
* Haven – Import foreign statistical formats into R via the embedded ReadStat C library.
* readr  – Read flat/tabular text files from disk (or a connection).
* Jsonlite  A fast JSON parser and generator optimized for statistical data and the web.
* ggplot2 – A system for ‘declaratively’ creating graphics, based on “The Grammar of Graphics”.
* htmlwidgets – A framework for creating HTML widgets that render in various contexts including the R console, ‘R Markdown’ documents, and ‘Shiny’ web applications.
* leaflet – Create and customize interactive maps using the ‘Leaflet’ JavaScript library and the ‘htmlwidgets’ package.
* tilegramsR  – Provide R spatial objects representing Tilegrams.
* dplyr – A fast, consistent tool for working with data frame like objects, both in memory and out of memory.
* broom – Convert statistical analysis objects from R into tidy data frames
* tidytext – Text mining for word processing and sentiment analysis using ‘dplyr’, ‘ggplot2’, and other tidy tools.
* mxnet – The MXNet R packages brings flexible and efficient GPU computing and state-of-art deep learning to R.
* tensorflow – TensorFlow™ is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs.
