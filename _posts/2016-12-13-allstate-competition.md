# Solution Sharing for the Allstate Competition at Kaggle

I participated in [the Allstate competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity/) at Kaggle and finished 54th out of 3,055 teams.  I shared my solution in the forum after the competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity/forums/t/26459/code-and-notes-for-56-solution-more):

Congrats for winners and top performers, and thanks for great sharing to all contributors in the forum. It’s always a humbling experience to compete at Kaggle. I learn so much at every competition from a lot of fellow kagglers.

Here I’d like to share my code base and notes for the competition:

* [Code repo with competition notes](https://gitlab.com/jeongyoonlee/allstate-claims-severity)
* [Wiki page with internal LB](https://gitlab.com/jeongyoonlee/allstate-claims-severity/wikis/home)

My friends and I have been using the framework based on Makefiles for competitions for years now and it has worked great so far.

Introduction to the framework is available on [the TalkingData forum](https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-mobile-user-demographics/forums/t/23463/team-ensemble-s-solution-framework)

Our previous code repo for past competitions are also available at:

* [For Bosch (#22)](https://gitlab.com/mbay/bosch)
* [For TalkingData (#37)](https://gitlab.com/jeongyoonlee/talkingdata)

Hope it’s helpful.
