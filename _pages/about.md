# About Kaggler TV

We are Data Scientists and Kagglers.

We enjoy participating in data science competitions. In every competition, we learn something new – new algorithms (Factorization Machine, Follow-the-Regularized-Leader), new tools (Vowpal Wabbit, XGBoost, LightGBM, Keras), and new domain knowledge. It helps us keep our skills up-to-date in the fast evolving fields of Machine Learning and Data Science.

With Kaggler TV, we’d like to share our learning and experiences with others. We’ll announce new releases of Python package Kaggler – that we wrote for Kaggle competitions – here as well.

If you’re interested in contributing to Kaggler.com, please email us at kagglertv@gmail.com.

Enjoy!
